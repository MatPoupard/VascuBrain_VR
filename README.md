# VascuBrain VR

## Overview
This VR application replicates a classroom environment centered around a desk featuring a 3D model of the brain and its arterial system. It is designed to support neuroanatomy learning, specifically focusing on the cerebral arterial system, by providing interactive and immersive experiences (see https://youtu.be/UsXl2mRPmq4).

## Features
- **3D Model Interaction**: Participants can touch, cut, grab, and resize the model to explore the cerebral vascular system.
- **Real-Time Explanations**: Verbal explanations and animations are triggered by interactions.
- **Virtual Tablet Interface**: Displays a written summary and allows participants to revisit artery-related information.
- **French Language Support**: Both oral instructions and written content are in French.

## Interactivity Modalities
Three conditions were designed to explore different levels of user interaction:
- **Passive Condition**: Participants visualize pre-programmed animations of the brain's arterial system without direct interaction.
- **Guided Condition**: Participants interact with the 3D model under a guided sequence determined by the application. A blue virtual hand indicates the specific action and artery to interact with.
- **Active Condition**: Participants freely explore the 3D model, touching and cutting any artery to access detailed information about its name, origin, function, and vascular territory.

## Development
- Developed in **Unity** using **OculusVR SDK** for VR interactions.
- Compatible with **Meta Quest** and other VR headsets supporting OpenXR.
- Based on a **22-minute video lecture** and focus group discussions with two anatomy instructors.
